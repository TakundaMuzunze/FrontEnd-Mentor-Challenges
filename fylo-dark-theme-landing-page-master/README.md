## Overview 📋

Welcome to my solution for the Fylo Landing Page challenge! The goal was to create a landing page that closely matches the provided design. The page should be fully responsive and adapt to different screen sizes. I utilized HTML and CSS to build the layout and styles, and used JavaScript to ensure a user-friendly experience.
